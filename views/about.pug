          p Do you want to work with a Full Stack Javascript Developer with a lot of intercultural work experience, a passion for transmitting knownledge and learning new things? Look no further! I'm in the process of switching careers , but that doesn't mean I can't apply old skills to my new field! I'm the perfect candidate if you need someone: who can work alone AND in a team, who isn't afraid of discovering new concepts and ideas, who has a lot of experience guiding and teaching peers and who can assimilate lots of information quickly.
